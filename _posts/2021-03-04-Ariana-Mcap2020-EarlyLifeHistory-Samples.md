## Processing Ariana's *Montipora capitata* Larval Development Physiological Samples from July 2020

### Goal:
Process all of the physiological data (i.e. counts, size, symbiont counts) for the *Montipora capitata* (vertical spawner) developmental timepoint samples (n=40). Samples were collected at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in July 2020 and are apart of a larger project which focuses on early life history energetics and symbiotic integration in vertical and horizontal transmission corals.

### Count Protocol:

**Materials**
 - Glass pipette
 - [OMAX compound light microscope](https://www.amscope.com/compound-microscopes.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpGAZ_TUEvUZC3dfCPwTPWsNgzutgcwHwgBuKzaXCTCSDYKy2NENyPhoCH84QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&p=3)
 - 70% ethanol solution
 - 3 cell culture dishes
 - Hand held tally counter


**Protocol Steps**
1. I removed the physiological larval samples (H1-40) from the -4 Â°C fridge behind the titrator.
2. I carefully used 70% ethanol and the glass pipette to remove all of the contents of each tube into a cell culture dish.
3. I first counted one of the fertilized egg replicates by hand to get a total of 1,047 fertilized eggs total in sample H1. After discussing with Ariana, we decided to take a subset (roughly 200-300 fertilized eggs) of samples that had large amounts in them. The first 8 samples (H1 to H8) had large amounts so I labeled new tubes (ex: H1_1, H2_1, H3_1....H8_1) and took a subset sample (~200-300).
4. To count each sample, I repeated step 2 and then counted all the individuals in each tube moving the contents in one cell culture dish to the next whilst keeping track of counts using the hand held tally counter.
5. If I was ever concerned that individuals were stuck together or too small to count by eye, I placed the cell culture dish under the 4x magnification on the compound light microscope.
6. In between each count, I cleaned the glass pipette and cell culture dishes with the 70% ethanol solution.

#### Notes for count data completed on 20210304
- Noticed that the larvae 1 timepoint replicates were slightly degraded but still had a sufficient amount of larvae that was good

### **Symbiont Count Protocol**:

###### I had to first troubleshoot various methods so that we could properly homogenize the eggs to larvae developmental stage samples. I had to ensure that the symbiont cells were not lysing or degrading due to the sonicator. I used 1 mL aliquots of Emma's adult Mcap (n = 2) and Pacuta (n = 1) tissue homogenate samples and Hollie's Mcap developmental timepoint samples (n = 6) to test sonicator and homogenizing methods.

**Materials**
 - Glass pipette
 - [OMAX compound light microscope](https://www.amscope.com/compound-microscopes.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpGAZ_TUEvUZC3dfCPwTPWsNgzutgcwHwgBuKzaXCTCSDYKy2NENyPhoCH84QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&p=3)
 - Vortex
 - Haemocytometer
 - Hand held tally counter
 - [Sonicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/master/Lab_Resourses/Equipment_Protocols/Equip_Images/Sonicator.jpg)
 - [Transformer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/master/Lab_Resourses/Equipment_Protocols/Equip_Images/Simran_Transformer.jpg)
 - 1000 uL pipette
 - Combination tube rack


**Protocol Steps**
1. Since the sonicator had a 220V outlet intended for use in Mo'orea, we had to order a transformer to convert the voltage safely.

***Always read the instructions carefully when operating a transformer and make sure there is no liquid around the transformer***

2. Once unpacked, I plugged the transformer into a 110V outlet and read the instructions carefully. I changed the INPUT to the transformer to 110V (this step is extremely important, make sure the voltage you plug the transfromer into matches the INPUT tab located in the back of the transformer).

3. With the transformer turned to OFF, I plugged in the sonicator into the 220V outlet on the transformer and tested that it turned on with no noise or spark.

4. Following the [sonicator instruction manual](http://redstarvietnam.com/media/lib/ba_elmasonic_easy_en.pdf), I filled the sonicator 2/3rds of the way which was 2,000 mL.
    - This specific sonicator does not have a way to change the frequency settings, you can only adjust the time it runs for and the temperature it runs at.

5. Placed a combination tube rack with the 1.5 mL tube size facing up to hold the test tubes while the sonicator runs.

6. Tested the sonicator by adjusting the time setting in increasing intervals and using subsequent counts to make sure cells were not being lysed or degraded.

#### **Notes for 20210321**

- I started to notice that cells started to lyse and degrade after a total time in sonicator of 15 minutes. The next step was to test Hollie's 2018 Mcap developmental timeseries samples, making sure to test samples from eggs to larvae.


#### **Symbiont count data for test samples completed on 20210323**

- I used Hollie's 2018 Mcap developmental timeseries samples from fertilized eggs, gastrula, and larvae stages.

#### **Notes for 20210323**

- I noticed that the sonicator seemed to be more just mixing the samples but did not seem strong enough to breakdown the samples on its own. We decided to use a plastic pestle to break apart the initial layer of the individuals and sonicated them again. It seemed to work on two of the samples but not the last one and I did not want to reach the limit where the cells would start to lyse. I instead used the plastic pestle, the homogenizer, and the vortex to get the samples to fully homogenize within the tubes. We decided this was the best step moving forward since the sonicator did not have a setting to adjust the frequency.


#### **Symbiont count data for test samples and Ariana samples completed on 20210325**

- I used Hollie's 2018 Mcap developmental timeseries samples from fertilized eggs, cleaving eggs, and swimming larvae stages to test the plastic pestle, homogenizer, and vortex sequence of steps again before moving forward. Once we were satisfied with how well the samples were homogenized using this method, I moved forward with counts for Ariana's samples.

#### **Notes for 20210325**

- Happy with how the sample counts turned out and how homogenized they were for the symbiont counts. There was some tissue remains left within the samples under the microscope but not enough to disturb the accuracy of the counts.
