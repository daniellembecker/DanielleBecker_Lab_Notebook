## Processing Ariana's *Montipora capitata* Larval Development Physiological Samples from July 2020

### Goal:
Process all of the physiological data (i.e. counts, size, symbiont counts) for the *Montipora capitata* (vertical spawner) developmental timepoint samples (n=40). Samples were collected at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in July 2020 and are apart of a larger project which focuses on early life history energetics and symbiotic integration in vertical and horizontal transmission corals.

### Count Protocol:

**Materials**
 - Glass pipette
 - [OMAX compound light microscope](https://www.amscope.com/compound-microscopes.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpGAZ_TUEvUZC3dfCPwTPWsNgzutgcwHwgBuKzaXCTCSDYKy2NENyPhoCH84QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&p=3)
 - 70% ethanol solution
 - 3 cell culture dishes
 - Hand held tally counter


**Protocol Steps**
1. I removed the physiological larval samples (H1-40) from the -4 Â°C fridge behind the titrator.
2. I carefully used 70% ethanol and the glass pipette to remove all of the contents of each tube into a cell culture dish.
3. I first counted one of the fertilized egg replicates by hand to get a total of 1,047 fertilized eggs total in sample H1. After discussing with Ariana, we decided to take a subset (roughly 200-300 fertilized eggs) of samples that had large amounts in them. The first 8 samples (H1 to H8) had large amounts so I labeled new tubes (ex: H1_1, H2_1, H3_1....H8_1) and took a subset sample (~200-300).
4. To count each sample, I repeated step 2 and then counted all the individuals in each tube moving the contents in one cell culture dish to the next whilst keeping track of counts using the hand held tally counter.
5. If I was ever concerned that individuals were stuck together or too small to count by eye, I placed the cell culture dish under the 4x magnification on the compound light microscope.
6. In between each count, I cleaned the glass pipette and cell culture dishes with the 70% ethanol solution.

#### Notes for count data completed on 20210304
- Noticed that the larvae 1 timepoint replicates were slightly degraded but still had a sufficient amount of larvae that was good

### Symbiont Count Protocol:

###### I had to first troubleshoot various methods so that we could properly homogenize the eggs to larvae developmental stage samples. I had to ensure that the symbiont cells were not lysing or degrading due to the sonicator. I used 1 mL aliquots of Emma's adult Mcap (n = 2) and Pacuta (n = 1) tissue homogenate samples and Hollie's Mcap developmental timepoint samples (n = 6) to test sonicator and homogenizing methods. 

**Materials**
 - Glass pipette
 - [OMAX compound light microscope](https://www.amscope.com/compound-microscopes.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpGAZ_TUEvUZC3dfCPwTPWsNgzutgcwHwgBuKzaXCTCSDYKy2NENyPhoCH84QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&p=3)
 - Vortex
 - Haemocytometer
 - Hand held tally counter
 - [Sonicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/master/Lab_Resourses/Equipment_Protocols/Equip_Images/Sonicator.jpg)
 - [Transformer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/master/Lab_Resourses/Equipment_Protocols/Equip_Images/Simran_Transformer.jpg)
 - 1000 uL pipette


**Protocol Steps**
1. Since the sonicator had a 220V outlet intended for use in Mo'orea, we had to order a transformer to convert the voltage safely.

***Always read the instructions carefully when operating a transformer and make sure there is no liquid around the transformer***

2. Once unpacked, I plugged the transformer into a 110V outlet and read the instructions carefully. I changed the INPUT to the transformer to 110V (this step is extremely important, make sure the voltage you plug the transfromer into matches the INPUT tab located in the back of the transformer).

3. With the transformer turned to OFF, I plugged in the sonicator into the 220V outlet on the transformer and tested that it turned on with no noise or spark.

4. Following the [sonicator instruction manual](http://redstarvietnam.com/media/lib/ba_elmasonic_easy_en.pdf), I filled the sonicator 2/3rds of the way which was 2,000 mL. 
    - This specific sonicator does not have a way to change the frequency settings, you can only adjust the time it runs for and the temperature it runs at.

5. Tested the sonicator by increasing time intervals for each sample and using subsequent counts to make sure cells were not being lysed or degraded.
