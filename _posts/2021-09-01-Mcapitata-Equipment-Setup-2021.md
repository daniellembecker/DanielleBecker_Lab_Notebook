# Overview  

Post detailing tank and experimental set up for *Montipora capitata* coral spawning in Hawaii in June 2021.  

# Equipment Preparation  

Set up 4 mesocosm tanks at HIMB point and Tobo Labs with input of sand filtered seawater. Constructed n=12 conical vessels for larval rearing with square ~25 L food grade containers. 

Constructed banjo filters with 3" PVC coulers and 153 um mesh. Water fed into conicals with manifold and tubing. Water input into header/sump tanks in large coolers below n=2 black tanks, 1 per temperature treatment (high and ambient, temp treatments not started until larval development), 6 conicals per temperature. 

Coolers equipped with 2 heaters and pump to pump water through manifold into conicals. Black tank for high treatment had pump for circulation and 2 heaters, such that temp control for high treatment was achieved through 2 heaters in water bath (black tanks) and header (coolers). No heating in ambient tank. Note that debris was in the seawater and in the future filtered seawater would be best.  
 
Double layer of shade cloth covered all tanks.
