# Protocol for usage of the Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer

#### Goal:
Use the Jenkins lab NanoDrop at URI to measure the nucleic acid concentration and quantify purity ratios for a high molecular weight DNA sample from *Acropora pulchra* sperm.

#### Materials and Equipment:

- [NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/ND2000CLAPTOP)
- [NanoDrop 2000c Software](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis/molecular-spectroscopy/uv-vis-spectrophotometry/instruments/nanodrop/software.html)
- Gloves
- Kimwipe
- 0.1 uL to 2.0 uL pipette
- 0.1 uL to 2.0 uL filtered pipette tips
- Blank for measurement calibration (e.g., UltraPure water, Elution Buffer, etc. whatever your sample is eluted in)

### Protocol Steps

1. Contact Dr. Bethany Jenkins or Dr. Chris Lane lab members to confirm that you can use the NanoDrop. There is also another [NanoDrop](https://web.uri.edu/riinbre/nanodrop-8000-2/) in the URI RI-INBRE lab for free use.
2. Once trained on the Jenkins Lab NanoDrop, begin your processing by pressing the enter button a few times on the keyboard of the ViewSonic windows computer to view the screen (never turn off monitor or system, it is always on idle).
3. Double-click on the NanoDrop 2000 software on the desktop.
4. While waiting for the software to load, raise the metal grey sampling arm of the NanoDrop carefully. You will see a black ring with a small metal grey point in the center, this is the lower measurement pedestal, the upper measurement pedestal is a small grey metal point on the top of the raised sampling arm.

5. Using a kimwipe, gently wipe the lower and upper measurement pedestal.

6. After wiping the pedestals, you will see the software has loaded to a homepage that has a range of selections from Nucleic Acid to Protein BCA to Cell Cultures protocol options.

7. For my goals, I selected the Nucleic Acid protocol.
