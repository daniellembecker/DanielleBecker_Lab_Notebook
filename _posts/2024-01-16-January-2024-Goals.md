Reflection on monthly goals:
              
1. SICB conference presentation
- Well done on restructuring and presentation, good feedback overall. Can improve on being more concise throughout, give the audience the information they want and need to hear the story and get excited about the research! 

2. Write full methods, physiological results, introduction, and abstract for A. pulchra gametogenesis paper (Ch.2)
- Completed all methods for A.pul manuscript, completed general introduction and abstract outline. Continue working on flushing out the story completely.

3. Send Knauss Fellowship for reviews
- Came leaps and bounds on this application with ~5 reviewers feedback and finally feeling like it is at the final stages :)

4. ICRS apps? Ruth Gates?
- Not necessary for more funding at the moment, have a draft from previous years I can work on if needed

5. Map sequences for heatwave manuscript to de novo transcriptome
- Got through mapping phase for both approaches, ran into error at creating matrices, probably linked to the duplication we are seeing, revisit after we hear back from Azenta

6. Use methylseq kits for heatwave samples
- On hold, not immediately necessary without genome construction, can revisit down the line for my chapter specific objectives

7. Histological image analyses
- Created general diagrams for each stage, flushed out characteristics for each step for oogenesis and spermatogenesis, working through troubleshooting for size measurements.

8. JEB paper review 
- Pushed back till this month and was approved by JEB since applying for USAjobs and Knauss this month.


Ways forward:

JUST KEEP SWIMMING, keep up on your organizing of hours, daily, weekly goals and stick to them! End of the month got a bit busy with new TA responsibilities and office hours taking a big chunk of time. Make sure to include this in plans whenever I set my intentions for the week.
