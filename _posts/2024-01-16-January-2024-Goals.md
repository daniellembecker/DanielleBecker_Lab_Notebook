2. Write full methods, physiological results, introduction, and abstract for A. pulchra gametogenesis paper (Ch.2)
3. Send Knauss Fellowship for reviews
4. ICRS apps? Ruth Gates?
5. Map sequences for heatwave manuscript to de novo transcriptome
6. Use methylseq kits for heatwave samples
7. Histological image analyses
8. JEB paper review 


### Sample processing

1. Methylseq library preparation for heatwave samples, n = 12

### Data analysis

1. Finish stats for A. pul gametogenesis paper
2. Work on DEG analysis after mapping sequences to de novo transcriptome
	- See about duplication errors through trinity pipeline approach
3. Histological image/gonad analyses
