# Counting the E5 September and November 2020 Endosymbiont Samples

### Goal:
Process all remaining endosymbiont samples collected for the [E5 uROL Epigenetics Project](https://urol-e5.github.io). The remaining endosymbiont samples were collected in September (n = 75) and November (n = 113) 2020 and fixed in 10% formalin for transportation back to URI on November, 22nd 2020.


### Process:

**Followed the [E5 Symbiodiniaceae Cell Density Counting Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) with a few modifications for samples fixed in 10% formalin.**

When beginning the protocol, I noticed that the endosymbiont pellets within the samples that had been fixed in 10% formalin were very compacted. After trying various methods of vortexing and breaking apart the pellets using a pipette, the samples were still not homogenized. I added a few steps to the [E5 Symbiodiniaceae Cell Density Counting Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-07-Cell_Density-Protocol.md) to ensure the samples were homogenized.

### Additional processing steps for endosymbiont samples that have been fixed in 10% formalin:

**Additional Materials**
 - [Homogenizer](https://proscientific.com/hand-held-homogenizers/bio-gen-pro200-homogenizer/)
 - [5 mm Homogenizer Probe](https://proscientific.com/generator-probe-list/5mm-x-75mm-flat-bottom-generator-probe-0.5ml-2ml-micro-tubes/)
 - 10% bleach solution
 - Isopropanol wipes
 - Haemocytometer designated for formalin in flume hood

**Additional Protocol Steps**
1. Allow formalin fixed samples to warm to room temperature.
2. Set up the homogenizer following the [manual](https://proscientific.com/Biogen%20pro200%201215.compressed.pdf).
3. Fill one small cup with 10% bleach solution, and two others with DI water.
4. Vortex sample for ~10 seconds.
5. Using a glass or plastic pipette, try to carefully break apart the pellet at the bottom of the tube.
6. Carefully insert the homogenizer into the tube and homogenize the sample at the lowest setting for ~10-15 seconds.
  - Look at the tube while homogenizing and make sure the pellet is being broken down.
  - If the sample is still not homogenizing, slowly increase the speed of the homogenizer for a few seconds.
7. Vortex the sample for ~10 seconds before loading the haemocytometer for the first time following the E5 protocol above, and remember to always vortex the sample before each subsequent loading.
8. Between each sample, clean the homogenizer in a 10% bleach solution for 10 seconds, DI wash #1 for 10 seconds, DI wash #2 for 10 seconds, then wipe down with an isopropanol wipe.

**Daily Notes (20210223)**
- Samples POR-209, POC-366, and POR-214 had much smaller pellets than the rest
