## Titrations to Track Total Alkalinity in the CBLS WetLab Tank System 

### **Goal**
Conduct titrations to track the total alkalinity of the CBLS WetLab tank system located on the bottom floor of the Center for Biotechnology and Life Sciences at URI. The Putnam Lab conducts various experiments within the tank system which requires stable tank conditions.

### **Tank Identifications**

**Blue Tank  = Water Table  = BT**

**Quarantine Tank  = Biocube Quarantine Tank  = QT**

**Header Tank  = Header Tank  = HT**


### **Process**

All samples will be processed following the established [Putnam Lab Titrator Protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resourses/Equipment_Protocols/Titrator_Protocols/Titrator_Protocol.md).

All data processed and collected on the Putnam Lab Titrator will be available on the [Putnam Lab Titrator GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Titrator).

**Notes**
- Before the titration run, salinity was measured following the [conductivity calibration protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resourses/Equipment_Protocols/Orion_MultiParameter_Sensor_Protocol.md#Conductivity).
- CRM was a little off but was getting older, still in acceptable range.

**Notes**
- Before the titration run, salinity was measured following the [conductivity calibration protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resourses/Equipment_Protocols/Orion_MultiParameter_Sensor_Protocol.md#Conductivity).
- When I looked back at the CRM accuracy data ran in the past three weeks, I noticed that the values were <1% off in terms of accuracy after troubleshooting and checking that there were no bubbles in the acid line and the pH values were good. I also opened a new CRM bottle because I thought maybe the CRM had just sat too long. Once I noticed that the second CRM I ran was still off, I knew that there was probably some contamination with the acid titrant. I then swithced out the acid titrant with a new bottle of the same batch number (A22) and ran another round of CRMs to find that that was the issue. I think that the issue was we use the purge HCl cup underneath the stirrer when the titrator is not in use some build-up of acid precipitate occurs in the cup. Moving forward, when you do the acid purge we need to make sure to first clean this cup with DI water into the waste containers because I think what was happening was the purged HCl we normally put back into the bottle was mixing with this precipitate causing contamination in the acid titrant. 
- I also trained Lauren on the titrator today and she will be taking over the CBLS titrations from now on.
