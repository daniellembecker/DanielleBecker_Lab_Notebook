March 2024 goals and daily notebook entries. 

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Submit molecular underpinnings (Ch.1)
2. A.pul gametogenesis final figures, results sections for histology analysis
3. Marine heatwaves manuscript figures
4. POC species identification E5

### Sample processing

1. Histological image analysis (abundance and size)
2. Library prep for heatwave WGBS samples (12)

### Data analysis

1. BS-SNPer, filter SNPs from WGBS data
2. Work on DEG analysis for heatwave after mapping sequences to de novo transcriptome
3. Histological image/gonad analyses
