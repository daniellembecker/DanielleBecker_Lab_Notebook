# Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol for Gametogenesis January 2022 samples

Zymo's [Quick-DNA/RNATM Miniprep Plus Kit](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) kit was modified for our lab.

Based on Putnam Lab protocols written by: [E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/), [K. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md), and [E. Strand](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-02-27-Holobiont-Integration-March-Extractions.md).

### **Goal**
Process DNA-RNA extractions for the 12-month [Gametogenesis time series project](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis) in Mo'orea, French Polynesia which investigates the roles of parental effects and epigenetic inheritance in acclimatization and adaptation. The goal of my proposed research is to characterize maternal provisioning, epigenetic inheritance, and cross-generational impacts of thermal stress on *Acropora pulchra* throughout gametogenesis and early development (i.e., embryo, larval development).

### **Samples Remaining**

**January 2022 through August 2022 samples were brought back with CITES permit 20220819 and stored at URI in the [flammable fridge (B)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IMYmnNsN4D9cFbgLVdGKz67Albb3LxEyBh2GMtREMPU/edit#gid=851542879) and the [-80°C freezer (J)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IMYmnNsN4D9cFbgLVdGKz67Albb3LxEyBh2GMtREMPU/edit#gid=851542879).**

### Reagent Preparation

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) 20 mg Proteinase K with 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer or lyophilized (freeze-dried) 5 mg Proteinase K with 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Vortex to dissolve. Store at -20 &deg;C.

### Proteinase K Addition  

1. Place 300 uL of the DNA-RNA shield aliquot into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for extractions.    
2. Add 30 µl of PK digestion buffer to each sample tube (1:10 ratio of PK Digestion Buffer:Sample).  
3. Add 15 µl Proteinase K to each sample tube (1:2 ratio of Proteinase K:PK Digestion Buffer).  
4. Vortex for 5-10 seconds and spin down.
5. Set timer for 15 minutes and let samples sit. Start labeling other tubes and organizing on tube racks.
6. After 15 minutes, spin the samples down for 3 minutes at 16k rcf.
7. After samples are spun down, remove the liquid into new 1.5 mL tubes, be careful not to disturb the pellet.
8. Proceed to extraction steps.

20. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
21. Repeat steps 18-20 for a final elution volume of 100 µl
22. Label tubes, store at -20 &deg;C.

## RNA Extraction
1. Add equal volume (700 µl) 100% EtOH to the 1.5mL tubes labeled for RNA containing the original yellow column flow through
2. Vortex and spin down to mix
3. Add 700 µl of that liquid to the green RNA spin columns
4. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
5. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
6. Add 700 µl to the green RNA spin columns (the rest from the 1.5mL RNA tubes)

**We noticed that the RNA quantity for sample 431 was not detected, this could mean that there was possible contamination during the extraction process, or prior issues when the sample was taken that may have caused this. This sample will need to re-extracted and troubleshooted.**

### DNA Quality  
If DNA quantity is sufficient (typically >10 ng/µL) follow the PPP Agarose Gel [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/) to determine DNA quality. "Good" DNA should form a distinct band a the very top of the gel. See example below:

### DNA Quality - 12 January 2022 Samples

![image of gel](https://github.com/daniellembecker/DanielleBecker_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/20220823_extractions_gel.jpg)

- Good DNA quality with strong and distinct bands at the top of gel.

### RNA Quality  
If RNA quantity is sufficient follow the Tape Station [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/) to determine RNA quality and obtain a RNA Integrity Number (RIN). "Good" RNA should have a RIN above 8.0 and form two distinct peaks at the 18S and 28S locations. See example below:

### RNA Quality - 12 January 2022 Samples
You can also run RNA quality with a gel, which was done for our samples.
