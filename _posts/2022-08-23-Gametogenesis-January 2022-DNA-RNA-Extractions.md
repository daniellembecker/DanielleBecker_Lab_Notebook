# Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol for Gametogenesis January 2022 samples

Zymo's [Quick-DNA/RNATM Miniprep Plus Kit](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) kit was modified for our lab.

Based on Putnam Lab protocols written by: [E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/), [K. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md), and [E. Strand](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-02-27-Holobiont-Integration-March-Extractions.md).

### **Goal**
Process DNA-RNA extractions for the 12-month [Gametogenesis time series project](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis) in Mo'orea, French Polynesia which investigates the roles of parental effects and epigenetic inheritance in acclimatization and adaptation. The goal of my proposed research is to characterize maternal provisioning, epigenetic inheritance, and cross-generational impacts of thermal stress on *Acropora pulchra* throughout gametogenesis and early development (i.e., embryo, larval development).

### **Samples Remaining**

**January 2022 through August 2022 samples were brought back with CITES permit 20220819 and stored at URI in the [flammable fridge (B)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IMYmnNsN4D9cFbgLVdGKz67Albb3LxEyBh2GMtREMPU/edit#gid=851542879) and the [-80°C freezer (J)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IMYmnNsN4D9cFbgLVdGKz67Albb3LxEyBh2GMtREMPU/edit#gid=851542879).**

### Reagent Preparation

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) 20 mg Proteinase K with 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer or lyophilized (freeze-dried) 5 mg Proteinase K with 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Vortex to dissolve. Store at -20 &deg;C.

### Proteinase K Addition  

1. Place 300 uL of that aliquoted supernatant into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for extractions.    
2. Add 30 µl of PK digestion buffer to each sample tube (1:10 ratio of PK Digestion Buffer:Sample).  
3. Add 15 µl Proteinase K to each sample tube (1:2 ratio of Proteinase K:PK Digestion Buffer).  
4. Vortex for 5-10 seconds and spin down.
5. Set timer for 15 minutes and let samples sit. Start labeling other tubes and organizing on tube racks.
6. After 15 minutes, proceed to extraction steps.

## DNA Extraction
1. Set up yellow DNA spin columns and collection tubes, label appropriately
2. Warm elution liquids to 70 degrees &deg;C (10mM Tris HCl pH. 8.0 and RNase free water)
3. Add equal volume (345 µl) DNA/RNA lysis buffer to each sample tube
4. Finger flick to mix tubes
5. Add 700 µl (total volume) of sample gently to the yellow DNA spin column
6. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 3 minutes
7. **Important** Save the flow through from this step: transfer to a new 1.5mL tube labeled for RNA
8. Add 400µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
9. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
10. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
11. Add 700 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
12. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
13. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
14. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
15. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes 30 seconds**
16. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
17. Transfer yellow columns to new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
18. Add 50 µl warmed 10 mM Tris HCl to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filer
19. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes
20. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
21. Repeat steps 18-20 for a final elution volume of 100 µl
22. Label tubes, store at 4 &deg;C if quantifying the same day or the next, if waiting longer store in -20 &deg;C

## RNA Extraction
*Can do concurrently with DNA Extraction after DNA Extraction Step 7*
1. Add equal volume (700 µl) 100% EtOH to the 1.5mL tubes labeled for RNA containing the original yellow column flow through
2. Vortex and spin down to mix
3. Add 700 µl of that liquid to the green RNA spin columns
4. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
5. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
6. Add 700 µl to the green RNA spin columns (the rest from the 1.5mL RNA tubes)
7. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
    - Get DNase I from freezer
8. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
9. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to each green RNA column
10. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
11. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
12. Make DNase I treatment master mix:
    - 75µl DNA Digestion buffer x # of samples
    - 5µl DNase I x # of samples
13. Add 80 µl DNase I treatment master mix directly to the filter of the green RNA columns
14. Incubate at room temp for 15 minutes
15. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to each column
16. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
17. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
18. Add 700 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the green RNA spin columns
19. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
20. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
21. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer genetly to the green RNA spin columns
22. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes and 30 seconds**
23. Discard flow through (Zymo kit waste)
24. Transfer green columns to new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
25. Add 50µl warmed DNase/RNase free water to each green RNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filer
26. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes
27. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 1 minute
28. Repeat steps 25-27 for a final elution volume of 100µl
29. Label 1.5mL tubes on ice afterwards, and aliquot 5µl into PCR strip tubes to save for Qubit and Tape Station to avoid freeze-thaw of your stock sample
30. Store all tubes in the -80 &deg;C

## Extraction Content Analysis

These steps analyze the quantity and quality of the DNA/RNA extracted and may be done on a separate day from the extraction.

### RNA/DNA Quantity  
Follow Broad Range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) to analyze sample ++quantity++. Read all samples twice.

### DNA Quality  
If DNA quantity is sufficient (typically >10 ng/µL) follow the PPP Agarose Gel [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/) to determine DNA quality. "Good" DNA should form a distinct band a the very top of the gel. See example below:

![annotated-biomin-gel-batches-4-5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echille/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/master/images/annotated-biomin-gel-batches-4-5.png)

### DNA Quality - 12 January 2022 Samples

![image of gel](https://github.com/daniellembecker/DanielleBecker_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/20220823_extractions_gel.jpg)

- Good DNA quality with strong and distinct bands at the top of gel.

### RNA Quality  
If RNA quantity is sufficient follow the Tape Station [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/) to determine RNA quality and obtain a RNA Integrity Number (RIN). "Good" RNA should have a RIN above 8.0 and form two distinct peaks at the 18S and 28S locations. See example below:

### RNA Quality - 12 January 2022 Samples
You can also run RNA quality with a gel, which was done for our samples.
