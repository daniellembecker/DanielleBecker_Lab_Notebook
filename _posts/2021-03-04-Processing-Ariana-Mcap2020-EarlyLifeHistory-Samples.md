## Processing Ariana's *Montipora capitata* Larval Development Physiological Samples from July 2020

### Goal:
Process all of the physiological data (i.e. counts, size, symbiont counts) for the *Montipora capitata* (vertical spawner) developmental timepoint samples (n=40). Samples were collected at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in July 2020 and are apart of a larger project which focuses on early life history energetics and symbiotic integration in vertical and horizontal transmission corals.

### Count Process:

**Materials**
 - Glass pipette
 - [OMAX compound light microscope](https://www.amscope.com/compound-microscopes.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpGAZ_TUEvUZC3dfCPwTPWsNgzutgcwHwgBuKzaXCTCSDYKy2NENyPhoCH84QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&p=3)
 - 70% ethanol solution
 - 3 cell culture dishes
 - Hand held tally counter


**Protocol Steps**
1. I removed the physiological larval samples (H1-40) from the -4 Â°C fridge behind the titrator.
2. I carefully used 70% ethanol and the glass pipette to remove all of the contents of each tube into a cell culture dish.
3. I first counted one of the fertilized egg replicates by hand to get a total of 1,047 fertilized eggs total in sample H1. After discussing with Ariana, we decided to take a subset (roughly 200-300 fertilized eggs) of samples that had large amounts in them. The first 8 samples (H1 to H8) had large amounts so I labeled new tubes (ex: H1_1, H2_1, H3_1....H8_1) and took a subset sample (~200-300).
4. To count each sample, I repeated step 2 and then counted all the individuals in each tube moving the contents in one cell culture dish to the next whilst keeping track of counts using the hand held tally counter.
5. If I was ever concerned that individuals were stuck together or too small to count by eye, I placed the cell culture dish under the 4x magnification on the compound light microscope.
6. In between each count, I cleaned the glass pipette and cell culture dishes with the 70% ethanol solution.

#### Notes for count data completed on 20210304
- Noticed that the larvae 1 timepoint replicates were slightly degraded but still had a sufficient amount of larvae that was good
