1. Submit molecular underpinnings (Ch.1)
2. A.pul gametogenesis final figures, results sections for histology analysis
3. Marine heatwaves manuscript figures

### Sample processing

1. Histological image analysis (abundance and size)
2. Library prep for heatwave WGBS samples (12)

### Data analysis
