*IN PROGRESS*

## Calibrating new Odyssey PAR light loggers for March 2022 Mo'orea trip using the LICOR LI-1500 light sensor logger.

### Goal:
Use an integrating light source (LICOR LI-1500) to properly calibrate the four Odyssey PAR light loggers to be used in Mo'orea, French Polynesia.

### Considerations:
To determine the light fluctuations and number of lights you need to set up, you need to plan the light flux from zero to the highest light levels they could possibly see in the field at your field site.
  - For example, Jill Ashey was using light levels distinct to Rhode Island and saw light flux from 0 to ~500 photon flux density. While, I had to plan for light flux in Mo'orea, French Polynesia which can range from 0 to ~3,000 photon flux density. So while Jill used two lights in her set up, I needed to have five lights to get the range I needed.

###  <a name="set_up"></a> **Odyssey PAR Logger Set Up**

**Protocol Steps**
1. Before using the Odyssey PAR loggers, you must remove the **red washer** that is placed under the positive battery port before being able to connect. It is located on the top left side in the photo below.

2. Remove the cap of the loggers and use the hex key to carefully remove the screw, metal washer, and red plastic washer next to the red wire on the positive battery port.

3. Carefully put back in the metal washer and screw into the positive battery port. I suggest turning the logger over and placing the washer and screw in and holding it in place with the hex key before turning it over and screwing it in. It will look like the photo below.
