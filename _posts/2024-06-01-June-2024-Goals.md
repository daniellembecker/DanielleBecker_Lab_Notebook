June 2024 goals and daily notebook entries. 

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Submit molecular underpinnings (Ch.1)
2. A.pul gametogenesis final figures, results sections for histology analysis
3. Marine heatwaves manuscript transcriptome and gene expression

### Sample processing

1. Histological image analysis (abundance and size)
2. Library prep for heatwave WGBS samples (12)?

### Data analysis

1. Work on DEG analysis for heatwave after mapping sequences to de novo transcriptome
2. Histological image/gonad analyses 
3. Finish biomass data for gametogenesis
