This post details protocols for Sanger Sequencing and RFLP assays for species identification of *Porites* and *Pocillopora* from gDNA.  

# Overview 

This protocol contains updated and revised protocols as of 20240329 developed in the Putnam Lab and written by A. Huffmyer.  

OVERVIEW OF REASONS FOR PROTOCOL AND USING SEQUENCING/RFLPs

# Pocillopora 

This protocol uses Sanger sequencing to identify *Pocillopora* haplotypes. For samples that are identified to Haplotype 1a, an RFLP is required to further distinguish between *P. meandrina* and *P. grandis*.  

## Sample requirements 

This protocol requires extracted and quantified gDNA. We typically preserve samples in [Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield R1100-250](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/Zymo_r1100-250_dna_rna_shield.pdf) and extract DNA and RNA with the [Zymo Research Quick-DNA™ Miniprep Plus Kit D4069](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf).

OVERVIEW STATEMENT OF MARKER AND RFLP USE 

### Prepare restriction enzyme master mix 

- Prepare the restriction enzyme master mix. First thaw the Xhol RE and rCutSmart buffers on ice. 
- Calculate the volume of restriction enzyme and buffer needed for each reaction. Each reaction requires a 0.1 ratio of rCutSmart 10X buffer to total reaction volume. The reaction requires equal volumes of rCutSmart and Xhol.   

Here are two examples. The first equation is for 15uL sample volume in the reaction (use for dilute samples or weak amplification) or for reduced 7.5uL sample volumes (use for strong amplification to reduce volume used and allow for sufficient volume for troubleshooting).   

``` 
15 µL sample + 1.9 µL rCutSmart buffer + 1.9 µL Xhol = 18.8 µL total volume 
	- 1.9/18.8 = 0.10 

7.5 µL sample + 0.95 µL rCutSmart buffer + 0.95 µL Xhol = 9.4 µL total volume
	- 0.95/7.5 = 0.10  
```

- Multiply the volume of each component by the number of reactions + 10% error. 
- Combine Xhol and rCutSmart to generate a master mix.
