I began transferring and backing up data from Andromeda (URI server) to Unity.

# Transfers to Unity 

I am working on transferring the following files from Andromeda to Unity. The file paths indicate current location. I am only transferring raw data and not intermediate files.   

- E5 2020 project
	- RNAseq `/data/putnamlab/dbecks/Becker_E5/Becker_RNASeq`
	- WGBS `/data/putnamlab/dbecks/Becker_E5/WGBS_Becker_E5`

- Marine Heatwave 2022 project 
	- SNP calling;trinity `/data/putnamlab/dbecks/Heatwave_A.pul_2022Project/data`
	- Scripts `/data/putnamlab/dbecks/Heatwave_A.pul_2022Project/scripts`

 I tried transferring on May 1st, just realized some data files did not go through, re-running globusconnect.
